 * @section Overview 1 Overview
 *
 * k-Wave is an open source MATLAB toolbox designed for the time-domain simulation of propagating
 * acoustic waves in 1D, 2D, or 3D. The toolbox has a wide range of functionality, but at its heart
 * is an advanced numerical model that can account for both linear or nonlinear wave propagation,
 * an arbitrary distribution of weakly heterogeneous material parameters, and power law acoustic
 * absorption (http://www.k-wave.org).
 *
 * This project is a part of the k-Wave toolbox accelerating 3D simulations using an optimized
 * CUDA/C++ implementation to run small to moderate grid sizes (64x64x64 to 512x512x512). This
 * code uses a single NVIDIA GPU to accelerate the simulations (AMD GPUs are not supported).
 *
 * Compiled binaries of the CUDA/C++ code are available from  (http://www.k-wave.org/download).
 * Both 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu / Debian) and  64-bit Windows  versions are provided. This Doxygen
 * documentation was created based on the Linux version and provides details on the
 * implementation of the CUDA/C++ code.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section Compilation 2 Compilation
 *
 * The source codes of <tt>kpsaceFirstOrder3D-CUDA</tt> are written using the C++11 standard
 * (optional OpenMP 2.0 library), NVIDIA CUDA 7.5 library and HDF5 1.8.x.
 *
 * There are variety of different C++ compilers that can be used to compile the source codes.
 * We recommend using the GNU C++ compiler (gcc/g++) version 4.8/4.9, the Intel C++ compiler
 * version 15.0, or Visual Studio 2013. The version of the compiler  is limited by the CUDA
 * architecture version. The code was tested with CUDA 7.0 and 7.5.
 * The codes can be compiled on 64-bit Linux and Windows. 32-bit systems are not supported due to
 * the the memory requirements even for small simulations.
 *
 * Before compiling the code, it is necessary to install CUDA, C++ compiler and the HDF5 library.
 * The GNU compiler is usually part of Linux distributions and distributed as open source.
 * It can be downloaded from http://gcc.gnu.org/ if necessary. The Intel compiler can be downloaded
 * from http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-composer-xe/. The Intel compiler is only free for
 * non-commercial use.

 * The CUDA library can be downloaded from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive.
 * The supported versions are 7.0 and 7.5. We cannot guarantee the code can be compiled with
 * later versions of CUDA.
 *
 * <b> 2.1 The HDF5 library installation procedure </b>

 * 1. Download the 64-bit HDF5 library  package for your platform
 * (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html). Please use version 1.8.x, the version 1.10.x
 * is not compatible with MATLAB yet.
 *
 * 2. Configure the HDF5 distribution. Enable the high-level library and specify
 * an installation folder by typing:
\verbatim ./configure --enable-hl --prefix=folder_to_install \endverbatim
 * 3. Make the HDF library by typing:
\verbatim make -j \endverbatim
 * 4. Install the HDF library by typing:
\verbatim make install \endverbatim
 *
 *
 * <b> 2.2 The CUDA installation procedure </b>
 *
 * 1. Download CUDA version 7.5 https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
 * 2. Follow the NVIDIA official installation guide for Windows and Linux
 *    http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-microsoft-windows
 *    and http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/.
 *
 *
 * <b> 2.3 Compiling the CUDA/C++ code </b>
 *
 * When the libraries and the compiler have been installed, you are ready to compile the
 * <tt>kspaceFirstOrder3D-CUDA </tt> code. The Makefile only supports code compilation under CUDA/g++
 * compiler, however using different compilers would be analogous (<tt>-ccbin</tt> parameter for
 * the <tt>nvcc </tt>compiler)
 *

 * 1. Download the <tt>kspaceFirstOrder3D-CUDA </tt> source codes.
 *
 * 2. Open the \c Makefile file.
 *    First, set the paths to CUDA and HDF5 libraries, then select how to link the code. Dynamic
 *    lining is preferred since it does not require reloading the CUDA-GPU driver, however the code
 *    will very likely only run on the machine where compiled. The static linking allows you you
 *     create a self-consistent binary with all libraries linked in.
 *
 * 3. Compile the source code by typing:
\verbatim make -j \endverbatim If you want to clean the distribution, type:
\verbatim make clean \endverbatim
 *
 *
 * @section Parameters 3 Command Line Parameters
 * The CUDA/C++ code requires two mandatory parameters and accepts a few optional parameters and
 * flags. Ill parameters, bad simulation files, and runtime errors such as out-of-memory problems,
 * lead to an exception followed by an error message shown and execution termination.
 *
 * The mandatory parameters \c -i and \c -o specify the input and output file. The file names
 * respect the path conventions for particular operating system. If any of the files is not
 * specified, cannot be found or created, an error message is shown and the code terminates.
 *
 * The \c -t parameter sets the number of threads used, which defaults the system maximum. For the
 * CUDA version, the number of threads is not critical, as the CPU only preprocess data. When
 * running on desktops with multiple GPUs, or clusters with per-GPU resource allocations, it may
 * be useful to limit the number of CPU threads.
 *
 * The \c -g parameter allows to explicitly select a GPU for the execution. The CUDA capable GPUs
 * can be listed by the system command \c nvidia-smi. If the parameter is not specified, the code
 * uses the first free GPU. If the GPUs are set in the CUDA DEFAULT mode, the first CUDA device
 * is selected. In order to get the automatic round-robin GPU selection working (to e.g. execute
 * multiple instances of the code on distinct GPUs), please set the GPUs into PROCESS_EXCLUSIVE mode.
 * On clusters with a PBS  scheduler, this is usually done automatically, so no need to change it
 * by user.
 *
 * The \c -r parameter specifies how often information about the simulation progress is printed out
 * to the command line. By default, the CUDA/C++ code prints out the  progress of the simulation,
 * the elapsed time, and the estimated time of completion in intervals corresponding to 5% of
 * the total number of times steps.
 *
 * The \c -c parameter specifies the compression level used by the ZIP library to reduce the size of
 * the output file. The actual compression rate is highly dependent on the shape of the sensor mask
 * and the range of stored quantities and may be computationally expensive. In general, the output
 * data is very hard to compress, and using higher compression levels can greatly increase the
 * time to save data while not having a large impact on the final file size. That's why we decided
 * to disable compression in default settings.
 *
 * The \c <tt>\--benchmark</tt> parameter enables the total length of simulation (i.e., the number
 * of time steps) to be overridden by setting a new number of time  steps to simulate. This is
 * particularly useful for performance evaluation and benchmarking. As the code performance is
 * relatively stable, 50-100 time steps is  usually enough to predict the simulation duration.
 * This parameter can also be used to quickly check the simulation is set up correctly.
 *
 * The \c <tt>\--verbose</tt> parameter enables to select between three levels of verbosity. For
 * routine simulations, the verbose level of 0 (the default one) is usually sufficient. For more
 * information about the simulation, checking the parameters of the simulation, code version,
 * GPU used, file paths, and debugging running scripts, verbose levels 1 and 2 may be very useful.
 *
 * The \c -h and <tt>\--help</tt> parameters print all the parameters of the C++ code. The
 * <tt>\--version </tt>parameter reports detail information about the code useful for  debugging and
 * bug reports. It prints out the internal version, the build date and time, the git hash allowing
 * us to track the version of the source code, the operating system, the compiler name and version
 * and the instruction set used.
 *
 * For jobs that are expected to run for a very long time, it may be useful to  checkpoint and
 * restart the execution. One motivation is the wall clock limit  per task on clusters where jobs
 * must fit within a given time span (e.g. 24 hours). The second motivation is a level of
 * fault-tolerance, where you can back up the state of the simulation after a predefined period.
 * To enable checkpoint-restart, the user is asked to specify a file to store the actual state of
 * the simulation by  <tt>\--checkpoint_file</tt> and the period in seconds after which the
 * simulation will be interrupted by <tt>\--checkpoint_interval</tt>.  When running on a cluster,
 * please allocate enough time for the checkpoint procedure  that can take a non-negligible amount
 * of time (7 matrices have to be stored in  the checkpoint file and all aggregated quantities are
 * flushed into the output file). Please note, that the checkpoint file name and path is not checked
 * at the beginning of the simulation, but at the time the code starts checkpointing. Thus make sure
 * the file path was correctly specified ((otherwise you will not find out the simulation crashed
 * until the first leg of the simulation finishes)). The rationale behind this is that to keep as
 * high level of fault tolerance as possible, the checkpoint file should be touched even when really
 * necessary.
 *
 * When controlling a multi-leg simulation by a script loop, the parameters of the code remains the
 * same in all legs. The first leg of the simulation creates a checkpoint  file while the last one
 * deletes it. If the checkpoint file is not found the simulation starts from the beginning. In
 * order to find out how many steps have been finished, please open the output file and read
 * the variable <tt>t_index</tt> and compare it with <tt>Nt</tt> (e.g. by the h5dump command).
 *
 *
 * The remaining flags specify the output quantities to be recorded during the  simulation and
 * stored on disk analogous to  the sensor.record input. If the \c -p or <tt>\--p\_raw</tt> flags
 * are set (these are equivalent), a time series of  the acoustic pressure at the grid points
 * specified by  the sensor mask is recorded. If the <tt>\--p_rms</tt>, <tt>\--p_max</tt>,
 * <tt>\--p_min</tt> flags  are set, the root mean square and/or maximum and/or minimum values of
 * the pressure at the grid points specified by  the sensor mask are recorded. If the
 * <tt>\--p_final</tt> flag is set, the values for the entire acoustic pressure field in the final
 * time step of the simulation is stored (this will always include the PML, regardless of  the
 * setting for <tt> `PMLInside'</tt>).
 * The flags <tt>\--p_max_all</tt> and <tt>\--p_min_all</tt> allow to calculate the maximum and
 * minimum values over the entire acoustic pressure field, regardless on the shape of the sensor
 * mask. Flags to record the acoustic particle velocity are defined in an analogous fashion. For
 * proper calculation of acoustic intensity, the particle velocity has to be shifted onto the same
 * grid as the acoustic  pressure. This can be done by setting <tt>\--u_non_staggered_raw</tt> flag,
 * that first shifts the  particle velocity and then samples the grid points specified by the sensor
 * mask. Since the  shift operation requires additional FFTs, the impact on the simulation time may
 * be significant.
 *
 * Any combination of <tt>p</tt> and <tt>u</tt> flags is admissible. If no output flag is set,
 * a time-series for the acoustic pressure is recorded. If it is not necessary to collect the output
 * quantities over the entire simulation, the starting time step when the collection begins can
 * be specified using the -s parameter.  Note, the index for the first time step is 1 (this follows
 * the MATLAB indexing convention).
 *
 * The <tt>\--copy_sensor_mask</tt> will copy the sensor from the input file to the output  one at
 *  the end  of the simulation. This helps in post-processing and visualisation of the outputs.

* @section HDF HDF5 File Structure
 *
 * The CUDA/C++ code has been designed as a standalone application which is not dependent  on MATLAB
 * libraries or a MEX interface. This is of particular importance when using servers and
 * supercomputers without MATLAB support. For this reason, simulation data must be transferred
 * between the CUDA/C++ code and MATLAB using external input and output files. These files are
 * stored using the Hierarchical Data Format HDF5 (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/). This is a data
 * model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports a variety of
 * datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data.
 * The HDF5 technology suite includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing,
 * and analysing data in the HDF5 format.
 *
 *
 * Each HDF5 file is a container for storing a variety of scientific data and is composed of two
 * primary types of objects: groups and datasets. An HDF5 group is a structure  containing zero or
 * more HDF5 objects, together with supporting metadata. A HDF5 group can be seen as a disk folder.
 * An HDF5 dataset is a multidimensional array of data elements, together with supporting metadata.
 * A HDF5 dataset can be seen as a disk file. Any HDF5 group or dataset may also have an associated
 * attribute list. An HDF5 attribute is a user-defined HDF5 structure that provides extra
 * information about an HDF5 object. More information can be obtained from the HDF5 documentation
 * (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/index.html).
 *
 *
 * kspaceFirstOrder3D-CUDA v1.1 introduces a new version of the HDF5 input and output file format.
 * The code is happy to work with both versions (1.0 and 1.1), however when working with an input
 * file of version 1.0, some features are not supported, namely the cuboid sensor mask, and
 * u_non_staggered_raw. When running from within the actual MATLAB K-Wave Toolbox, the files will
 * always be generated in version 1.1
 *
 * The HDF5 input file for the CUDA/C++ simulation code contains a file header with brief
 * description of the simulation stored in string attributes, and the root group `/' which stores
 * all the simulation properties in the form of 3D datasets (a complete list of input datasets is
 * given bellow).
 * The HDF5 checkpoint file contains the same file header as the input file and the root group `/'
 * with a few datasets keeping the actual simulation state.
 * The HDF5 output file contains a file header with the simulation description as well as
 * performance statistics, such as the simulation  time and memory consumption, stored in string
 * attributes.

 * The results of the simulation are stored in the root group `/' in the form of 3D datasets. If the
 * linear sensor mask is used, all output quantities are stored as datasets in the root group. If
 * the cuboid corners sensor mask is used, the sampled quantities form private groups containing
 * datasets on per cuboid basis.

 * The input and checkpoint file stores all quantities as three dimensional datasets with dimension
 * sizes designed by <tt>(Nx, Ny, Nz)</tt>. In order to support scalars and 1D and 2D arrays, the
 * unused dimensions are set to 1. For example, scalar variables are stored with a dimension size of
 * <tt>(1,1,1)</tt>, 1D vectors oriented in y-direction are stored with a dimension  size of
 * <tt>(1, Ny, 1)</tt>,  and so on. If the dataset stores a complex variable, the real and imaginary
 * parts are stored in an interleaved layout and the lowest used dimension size is doubled (i.e.,
 * Nx for a 3D matrix, Ny for a 1D vector oriented in the y-direction). The datasets are physically
 * stored in row-major order (in contrast to column-major order used by MATLAB) using either the
 * <tt>`H5T_IEEE_F32LE'</tt> data type for floating point datasets or <tt>`H5T_STD_U64LE'</tt> for
 * integer based datasets. All the datasets are store under the root group.
 *
 *
 * The output file of version 1.0 could only store recorded quantities as 3D datasets  under the
 * root group. However, with version 1.1 and the new cuboid corner sensor mask, the sampled
 * quantities may be laid out as 4D quantities stored under specific groups. The dimensions are
 * always <tt>(Nx, Ny, Nz, Nt)</tt>, every sampled cuboid is stored as a distinct dataset and the
 * datasets are grouped under a group named by the quantity stored. This makes the file
 * clearly readable and easy to parse.
 *
 *
 * In order to enable compression and more efficient data processing, big datasets are not stored as
 * monolithic blocks but broken into chunks that may be compressed by the ZIP library  and stored
 * separately. The chunk size is defined as follows:
 *
 * \li <tt> (1M elements, 1, 1) </tt> in the case of 1D variables - index sensor mask (8MB blocks).
 * \li <tt> (Nx, Ny, 1)         </tt> in the case of 3D variables (one 2D slab).
 * \li <tt> (Nx, Ny, Nz, 1)     </tt> in the case of 4D variables (one time step).
 * \li <tt> (N_sensor_points, 1, 1) </tt> in the case of the output time series (one time step of
 *                                    the simulation).
 *
 *
 * All datasets have two attributes that specify the content of the dataset. The \c `data_type'
 * attribute specifies the data type of the dataset. The admissible values are either \c `float' or
 * \c `long'. The \c `domain_type' attribute specifies the domain of the dataset. The admissible
 * values are either \c `real' for the real domain or \c `complex' for the complex domain. The
 * C++ code reads these attributes and checks their values.
