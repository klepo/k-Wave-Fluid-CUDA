 * @section   HDF5File HDF5 File Structure
 *
 * The CUDA/C++ code has been designed as a standalone application which is not dependent  on MATLAB libraries or a MEX
 * interface. This is of particular importance when using servers and supercomputers without MATLAB support. For this
 * reason, simulation data must be transferred between the CUDA/C++ code and MATLAB using external input and output
 * files. These files are stored using the [Hierarchical Data Format HDF5] (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/). This is a
 * data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports a variety of datatypes, and is
 * designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data.  The HDF5 technology suite includes
 * tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analysing data in the HDF5 format.
 *
 *
 * Each HDF5 file is a container for storing a variety of scientific data and is composed of two primary types of
 * objects: groups and datasets. An HDF5 group is a structure  containing zero or  more HDF5 objects, together with
 * supporting metadata. A HDF5 group can be seen as a disk folder. An HDF5 dataset is a multidimensional array of data
 * elements, together with supporting metadata. A HDF5 dataset can be seen as a disk file. Any HDF5 group or dataset
 * may also have an associated attribute list. An HDF5 attribute is a user-defined HDF5 structure that provides extra
 * information about an HDF5 object. More information can be obtained from the [HDF5 documentation]
 * (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/index.html).
 *
 *
 * kspaceFirstOrder-CUDA v1.3 uses the file format introduced in version 1.1. The code is happy to work with both
 * versions (1.0 and 1.1), however when working with an input file of version 1.0, some features are not supported,
 * namely the cuboid sensor mask, and <tt>u_non_staggered_raw</tt>. When running from within the actual MATLAB K-Wave
 * Toolbox, the files will always be generated in version 1.1.
 *
 * The HDF5 input file for the CUDA/C++ simulation code contains a file header with brief description of the simulation
 * stored in string attributes, and the root group <tt>'/'</tt> which stores  all the simulation properties in the form
 * of 3D  datasets no matter the medium is 2D or 3D (a complete list of input datasets is  given bellow).
 * In the case of 2D simulation, Nz equals to 1.
 *
 * The HDF5 checkpoint file contains the same file header as the input file and the root group <tt>'/'</tt> with a few
 * datasets keeping the actual simulation state. The HDF5 output file contains a file header with the simulation
 * description as well as performance statistics, such as the simulation  time and memory consumption, stored in string
 * attributes.

 * The results of the simulation are stored in the root group <tt>'/'</tt> in the form of 3D datasets. If the linear
 * sensor mask is used, all output quantities are stored as datasets in the root group. If the cuboid corners sensor
 * mask is used, the sampled quantities form private groups containing datasets on per cuboid basis.

 * The input and checkpoint file stores all quantities as three dimensional datasets with dimension sizes designed by
 * <tt>(Nx, Ny, Nz)</tt>. In order to support scalars and 1D and 2D arrays, the  unused dimensions are set to 1. For
 * example, scalar variables are stored with a dimension size of  <tt>(1,1,1)</tt>, 1D vectors oriented in y-direction
 * are stored with a dimension  size of  <tt>(1, Ny, 1)</tt>,  and so on. If the dataset stores a complex variable, the
 * real and imaginary parts are stored in an interleaved layout and the lowest used dimension size is doubled (i.e.,
 * Nx for a 3D matrix, Ny for a 1D vector oriented in the y-direction). The datasets are physically stored in row-major
 * order (in contrast to column-major order used by MATLAB) using either the <tt>'H5T_IEEE_F32LE'</tt> data type for
 * floating point datasets or <tt>'H5T_STD_U64LE'</tt> for integer based datasets. All the datasets are store under the
 * root group.
 *
 *
 * The output file of version 1.0 could only store recorded quantities as 3D datasets  under the root group. However,
 * with version 1.1 and the new cuboid corner sensor mask, the sampled quantities may be laid out as 4D quantities
 * stored under specific groups. The dimensions are always <tt>(Nx, Ny, Nz, Nt)</tt>, every sampled cuboid is stored as
 * a distinct dataset and the datasets are grouped under a group named by the quantity stored. This makes the file
 * clearly readable and easy to parse.
 *
 *
 * In order to enable compression and more efficient data processing, big datasets are not stored as monolithic blocks
 * but broken into chunks that may be compressed by the ZIP library  and stored separately. The chunk size is defined
 * as follows:
 *
 * \li <tt> (1M elements, 1, 1) </tt> in the case of 1D variables - index sensor mask (8MB blocks).
 * \li <tt> (Nx, Ny, 1)         </tt> in the case of 3D variables (one 2D slab).
 * \li <tt> (Nx, Ny, Nz, 1)     </tt> in the case of 4D variables (one time step).
 * \li <tt> (N_sensor_points, 1, 1) </tt> in the case of the output time series (one time step of
 *                                    the simulation).
 *
 *
 * All datasets have two attributes that specify the content of the dataset. The <tt>'data_type'</tt> attribute
 * specifies the data type of the dataset. The admissible values are either <tt>'float'</tt> or <tt>'long'</tt>. The
 * <tt>'domain_type'</tt> attribute  specifies the domain of the dataset. The admissible  values are either <tt>'real'
 * </tt> for the real domain or \c 'complex' for the complex domain. The C++ code reads these attributes and checks
 * their values.
