This project is a part of the k-Wave toolbox accelerating 3D simulations using
an optimized CUDA/C++ implementation to run small to moderate grid sizes 
(64x64x64 to 512x512x512). This code uses a single NVIDIA GPU to accelerate 
the simulations (AMD GPUs are not supported).

The source codes of kpsaceFirstOrder3D-CUDA are written using the C++11 
standard (optional OpenMP 2.0 library), NVIDIA CUDA 7.5 library and 
HDF5 1.8.x.
